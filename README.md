# Plant Tamer

Our app, “Plant Tamer” uses machine learning to identify plants the users photograph, distinguishing between native and invasive species. Invasive plants can be reported to valuable databases run by the province of Ontario. In return, the users unlock unique characters related to their discoveries that can be used in a game called “Plant Pandemonium.”
